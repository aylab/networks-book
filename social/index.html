Sociologists refer to the nodes, the people, as actors and the edges as ties.</p> <h2 id=the_empirical_study_of_social_networks ><a href="#the_empirical_study_of_social_networks" class=header-anchor >The Empirical Study of Social Networks</a></h2> <p>The true foundation of the field is usually attributed to psychiatrist Jacob Moreno. At a medical conference in New York City in March 1933 he presented the results of a set of investigations he had performed that may have been the first true social network studies, and the work attracted enough attention to merit a column in the New York Times a few days later. The following year Moreno published a book entitled <em>Who Shall Survive?</em> contained the seeds of the field of sociometry, which later became social network analysis.</p> <p>Moreno called patterns of interaction among various groups of people <em>sociograms</em>. The triangles and circles represent boys and girls respectively, and the figure reveals, among other things, that there are many friendships among the boys and many among the girls, but only one between a boy and a girl.</p> <p>There are many different possible definitions of an edge in such a network and the particular definition one uses will depend on what questions one is interested in answering about social networks.Edges might represent friendship between individuals, but they could also represent professional relationships, exchange of goods or money, communication patterns, romantic or sexual relationships, or many other types of connection. Direct questioning of experimental subjects is probably the most common method of determining the structure of social networks.</p> <p>In 1939 a group of ethnographers studying the effects of social class and stratification in the American south collected data on the attendance of social events by 18 women in a small town in Mississippi over a period of nine months. Rather than relying on interviews or surveys, however, they assembled their data using guest lists from the events and reports in the society pages of the newspapers. Their study, often referred to as the “Southern Women Study,” has been widely discussed and analyzed in the networks literature in the decades since its first publication. In this study, the women were found by the researchers to split into two sub- groups, tightly knit clusters of acquaintances with only rather loose between-cluster interaction.</p> <p>The power of social network analysis that its techniques have been applied to an extraordinary variety of different communities, issues, and problems: friendship and acquaintance patterns in local communities and in the population at large, and among university students and school children contacts between business people and other professionals; boards of directors of companies &#91;130, 131, 318&#93;; collaborations of scientists, movie actors, and musicians; sexual contact networks and dating patterns; covert and criminal networks such as networks of drug users or terrorists; historical networks; online communities such as Usenet and Facebook; and social networks of animals.</p> <h2 id=interviews_and_questionnaires ><a href="#interviews_and_questionnaires" class=header-anchor >Interviews and Questionnaires</a></h2> <p>If you are interested in friendship networks, you ask people who their friends are. If you are interested in business relationships you ask people who they do business with, and so forth. The asking may take the form of direct interviews with participants or the completion of questionnaires, either on paper or electronically. Indeed many modern studies, particularly telephone surveys, employ a combination of both interviews and questionnaires, wherein a professional interviewer reads questions from a questionnaire to a participant. By using a questionnaire, the designers of the study can guarantee that questions are asked, to a good approximation, in a consistent order and with consistent wording. By employing an interviewer to do the asking the study gains flexibility and reliability—interviewees of- ten take studies more seriously when answering questions put to them by a human being—and interviewers may be given some latitude to probe interviewees when they are unclear, unresponsive, or confused.</p> <p>There are a number of points to note about the data produced by name generators. First, the network ties, friendships in the case above, are determined by one respondent nominating another. This is a fundamentally asymmetric process. Individual A identifies individual B as their friend. In many cases B will also identify A as their friend, but there is no guarantee that this will happen and it is not uncommon for nomination to go in only one direction.</p> <p>Limiting the number of responses is for most purposes undesirable.</p> <p>Indeed in many networks it is found that a small number of individuals are nominated an unusually large number of times. While most children in a school are nominated as a friend of only a few others, a small number of popular children are nominated very many times.</p> <p>Sometimes we are interested in ties that are intrinsically symmetric between the two parties involved. An example is networks of sexual contact, which are widely studied to help us understand the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.</p> <p>Surveys can and often do ask respondents not just to name those with whom they have ties but to describe the nature of those ties as well. A survey which asks about several types of interactions generates data on several different networks at once but all built upon the same set of nodes. Networks such as this are sometimes called “multilayer” or “multiplex” networks.</p> <p>Surveys may also pose questions aimed at measuring the strength of ties. The main disadvantages of network studies based on direct questioning of participants are that they are first laborious and second inaccurate.</p> <p>Data based on direct questioning may also be affected by biases of various kinds. Yet, this problem is not unique to network studies.</p> <h3 id=ego-centered_networks ><a href="#ego-centered_networks" class=header-anchor >Ego-Centered Networks</a></h3> <p>Studies in which all or nearly all of the individuals in a community are surveyed, as described in the previous section, are called sociometric studies.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum from sociometric studies lie studies of <em>personal networks</em> or <em>ego-centered networks</em>. An ego-centered network is the network surrounding one particular individual, meaning that individual plus his or her immediate contacts. The individual in question is referred to as the ego and the contacts as alters.</p> <p>Obviously, surveys of this type, and studies of ego-centered networks in general, cannot reveal the structure of an entire network. One receives snap- shots of small local regions of the network, but in general those regions will not join together to form a complete social network. For example, if we wish to know about the degrees of nodes in a network—the numbers of ties people have— then a study in which a random sample of people are each asked to list their contacts may give us everything we need.</p> <p>An example of a study gathering ego-centered network data is the General Social Survey &#40;GSS&#41;, a large-scale survey conducted every year in the United States starting in 1972 and every two years since 1994. The GSS is not primarily a social network study. The purpose of the study is to gather data about life in the United States, how it is changing, and how it differs from or relates to life in other societies. The GSS questionnaire contains a large number of parts, ranging from general questions probing the demographics and attitudes of the participants to specific questions about recent events, political topics, or quality of life.</p> <p>Another example of an ego-centered network study is the study by Bernard et al. of the degree of individuals in acquaintance networks. They asked study participants to read through a list of several hundred family names drawn at random from a telephone directory, and to count up how many people they knew with names appearing on the list.</p> <p>Bernard and co-workers repeated their study with populations drawn from several different US cities and the results varied somewhat from city to city, but overall they found that the typical number of acquaintances, in the sense defined above, of the average person in the United States is about 2000.</p> <h2 id=direct_observation ><a href="#direct_observation" class=header-anchor >Direct Observation</a></h2> <p>An obvious method for constructing social networks is direct observation. One arena in which direct observation is essentially the only viable experimental technique is studies of the social networks of animals, since clearly animals cannot be surveyed using interviews or questionnaires. Not all animal species form interesting social networks, but informative studies have been performed of, among others, monkeys, kangaroos, and dolphins. The resulting networks can be regarded as directed and are sometimes called <em>dominance hierarchies</em>.</p> <h2 id=data_from_archival_or_third-party_records ><a href="#data_from_archival_or_third-party_records" class=header-anchor >Data From Archival or Third-Party Records</a></h2> <p>An increasingly important, voluminous, and often highly reliable source of social network data is archival records.</p> <p>A well-known, small-scale example of a study based on archival records is the work of Padgett and Ansell on the ruling families of Florence in the fifteenth century. In this study the investigators looked at contemporaneous historical records to determine which among the Florentine families had trade relations, marriage ties, or other forms of social contact with one another.</p> <p>In recent years, researchers have used archival records to construct a wide variety of different networks, some of them very large. A number of authors, for example, have looked at email networks. Email networks and telephone call graphs have another feature of particular interest: they are time-resolved—the date and time of each interaction is in principle known, allowing us to reconstruct after the fact the timing and duration of contacts between individuals if we have access to the appropriate data.</p> <p>Recent years have also seen the rapid emergence of online social networking services, such as Facebook and LinkedIn.</p> <h2 id=affiliation_networks ><a href="#affiliation_networks" class=header-anchor >Affiliation Networks</a></h2> <p>An important special case of network data from archival records is the <em>affiliation network</em>. An affiliation network is a network in which actors are connected via their membership in groups of some kind. For example, a famous case is the study by Galaskiewicz &#91;197&#93; of the CEOs of companies in Chicago in the 1970s and their social interaction via clubs that they attended: the CEOs are the actors and the clubs are the groups. Another example of a large affiliation network, one that holds more promise of providing useful results, is the co-authorship network of academics.</p> <h2 id=the_small-world_experiment ><a href="#the_small-world_experiment" class=header-anchor >The Small-World Experiment</a></h2> <p>A memorable and illuminating contribution to the social networks literature was made by the psychologist Stanley Milgram in the 1960s with his now-famous “small-world” experiment. Milgram was interested in quantifying the typical distance between actors in social networks.</p> <p>Milgram sent a set of packages, 96 in all, to volunteer participants in the US town of Omaha, Nebraska, who were recruited via a newspaper advertisement. The packages contained an official-looking booklet, or “passport,” emblazoned in gold letters with the name of Milgram’s home institution, Harvard University, plus a set of written instructions. The instructions asked the participants to get the passport to a specified target individual, a friend of Milgram’s who lived in Boston, Massachusetts, over a thousand miles away. The only information supplied about the target was his name &#40;and hence indirectly the fact that he was male&#41;, his address, and his occupation as a stockbroker. But the passport holders were not allowed simply to send their passport to the given address. Instead they were asked to send it to someone they knew on a first-name basis, more specifically to the person in this category who they felt would stand the best chance of getting the passport to the intended target. Thus they might decide to send it to someone they knew who lived in Massachusetts, or maybe someone who worked in the financial industry. The choice was up to them. Whoever they did send the passport to was then to repeat the process, sending it to one of their acquaintances, and so forth, so that after a succession of steps the passport would, with luck, find its way into the hands of its intended recipient. Since every step of the process corresponded to the passport’s changing hands between a pair of first-name acquaintances, the entire journey constituted a path along the edges of the social network formed by the set of all such acquaintanceships, and the length of the journey provided an upper bound on the distance through this network between the starting and ending individuals in the chain.</p> <p>Of the 96 passports sent out, 18 found their way to the stockbroker target in Boston. Milgram asked participants to record in the passport each step of the path taken, so he knew how long each path was, and he found that the mean length of completed paths from Omaha to the target in Boston was just 5.9 steps. This result is the origin of the idea of the “six degrees of separation,” the popular belief that there are only about six steps between any two people in the world.</p> <p>For a number of reasons this result is probably not very accurate. The initial recipients in the study were not chosen at random—they were volunteers who answered an advertisement—so they may not have been typical members of the population. At the very least, all of them were in a single town in a single country, which calls into question the extent to which the results of the study apply to the population of the world as a whole, or even to the population of the United States. Furthermore, Milgram used only a single target in Boston, and there is no guarantee this target was typical of the population either. Also we don’t know that chains took the shortest possible route to the target. Probably they did not, at least in some cases, so the lengths of the chains provide only an upper bound on the actual distance between nodes. Moreover, most of the chains were never completed. Many passports were discarded or lost and never made their way to the target. It is reasonable to suppose that the chances of getting lost were greater for passports that took longer paths, and hence that the paths that were completed were a biased sample, having typical lengths shorter than the average.</p> <p>For all of these reasons Milgram’s results should be taken with a large pinch of salt. Even so, the fundamental conclusion that node pairs in social networks tend on average to be connected by short paths is now widely accepted. That is, a large fraction of the target’s connections to the outside world seemed to be through only a few of his acquaintances, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as “funneling.” Milgram called such well-connected acquaintances “sociometric superstars.”</p> <p>The fact that a moderate number of passports did find their way to the intended target person shows not only that short paths exist in the acquaintance network, but also that people are good at finding those paths. Upon reflection this is quite a surprising result. As Kleinberg has shown, it is possible and indeed common for a network to possess short paths between nodes but for them to be hard to find unless one has complete information about the structure of the entire network, which the participants in Milgram’s studies did not. Kleinberg has conjectured that the network of acquaintances needs to have a special type of structure for the participants to find the paths they did with only limited knowledge of the network.</p> <p>On the other hand, the experiment experienced enormously lower rates of participation than Milgram’s, perhaps because the public is by now quite jaded in its attitude towards unsolicited mail. Of the 24 000 chains, only 384, or 1.5&#37;, reached their intended targets, compared with 19&#37; in Milgram’s case. Because of their better data and more careful statistical analysis, Dodds et al. were also able to compensate for biases due to unfinished chains and estimated that the true average path length for the experiment was somewhere between five and seven steps—very similar to Milgram’s result. However, Dodds et al. observed no equivalent of the “sociometric superstars” of Milgram’s experiment, raising the question of whether their appearance in Milgram’s case was a fluke of the particular target individual he chose rather than a generic property of social networks.</p> <p>They found that three characteristics were sought overwhelmingly more often than any others, namely the name of the target, their geographic location, and their occupation—the same three pieces of information that Milgram provided in his original experiment. For instance, in some cultures, parentage or religion were considered important identifying characteristics of the target.</p> <p>While the reverse small-world experiments do not directly tell us about the structure of social networks, they do give us information about how people perceive and deal with social networks.</p> <h2 id=snowball_sampling_contact_tracing_and_random_walks ><a href="#snowball_sampling_contact_tracing_and_random_walks" class=header-anchor >Snowball Sampling, Contact Tracing, and Random Walks</a></h2> <p>Studies of some populations, such as drug users or illegal immigrants, present special problems to the investigator because the members of these populations do not usually want to be found and are often wary of giving interviews. The most widely used such technique is <em>snowball sampling</em>.</p> <p>Standard techniques such as telephone surveys often do not work well when sampling hidden populations. The typical survey starts off rather like a standard ego-centered network study. You find one initial member of the population of interest and interview them about them- selves. Then, upon gaining their confidence, you invite them also to name other members of the target population with whom they are acquainted. Then you go and find those acquaintances and interview them in turn, asking them also to name further contacts, and so forth through a succession of “waves” of sampling. Pretty soon the process “snowballs” and you have a large sample of your target population to work with.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the technique is sufficiently useful for finding populations that are otherwise hard to pin down that it has been widely used, biases and all, in studies over the past few decades.</p> <p>A technique closely related to snowball sampling is contact tracing, which is essentially a form of snowball sampling applied to disease incidence. Some diseases, such as tuberculosis and HIV, are considered in many countries to be sufficiently serious that, when someone is discovered to be carrying them, an effort must be made to track down all those who might also have been infected. Then health authorities will make an effort to track down the people so identified and test them for HIV also. The process is repeated with any who test positive, tracing their contacts as well, and so forth, until all leads have been exhausted.</p> <p>There is another variant of snowball sampling that deals to some extent with the problems of bias in the sample. This is random-walk sampling. In this method one again starts with a single member of the target community and interviews them to determine their contacts. Then, however, instead of tracking down all of those contacts, one chooses one of them at random and interviews only that one at the next step. If the person in question cannot be found or declines to be interviewed, one chooses another contact, and the process is repeated. The advantage of the random-walk sampling method is that, as shown in Section 6.14.3, the asymptotic sampling probability of nodes in a random walk is simply proportional to node degree.</p> <p>Knowing this, and given that we determine degree as a part of the interview process, we can easily compensate for sampling bias by a suitable weighting of the results and make population estimates of quantities in a way that is, in theory at least, unbiased. Still, random-walk sampling is a significant improvement on standard snowball sampling. Its principal disadvantage is that it is relatively slow. Since the participants are interviewed serially, in a chain, rather than in parallel waves, a strict implementation of the method can take a long time to develop a large sample. One can get around this obstacle to some extent by running several short random walks in parallel instead of one long one, but the walks cannot be too short or they will not reach the asymptotic regime in which sampling is proportional to degree.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Tazmilur Saad, Ahmet Ay.
