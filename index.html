Indeed, networks are all around us, from the human brain to the internet to our circle of friends. All networks have an underlying order and adhere to basic laws. Understanding the structure and behavior of these networks will allow us to achieve amazing things, such as finding terrorists and halting a disease epidemic before it spreads.</p> <p>This course provides a broad overview of network science-addressing the computational techniques of network science as well as their applications and implications in biology, sociology, technology, and other fields. Across this course, we will build networks in a variety of fields, demonstrating that social networks, the internet, and cells are more alike than they are distinct – revealing crucial new insights into the linked world around us. Aside from the simple structural properties of real-world networks, the course will also cover topics such as dynamic network activities, including epidemics, network robustness, and communities in networks. We will also discuss the societal effects and implications of network analysis.</p> <p>Students will have the opportunity to apply what they&#39;ve learned about network science to real-world network data sets of their own choice. The course will present an exciting glimpse of the future century in science, in an inherently and increasingly interconnected world.</p> <div class=franklin-toc ><ol><li><a href="#course_objectives">Course Objectives</a><li><a href="#class_format">Class Format</a><li><a href="#course_resources">Course Resources</a><li><a href="#grading">Grading</a></ol></div> <h2 id=course_objectives ><a href="#course_objectives" class=header-anchor >Course Objectives</a></h2> <p>On completion of this course, students should be able to do the following:</p> <ul> <li><p>Understand and apply basic network science techniques.</p> <li><p>Know how to execute network analysis in Python.</p> <li><p>Know how to use network science on real life datasets, and properly interpret results</p> </ul> <h2 id=class_format ><a href="#class_format" class=header-anchor >Class Format</a></h2> <p>The class itself will be lecture format. These lectures will focus on the network theory and definitions that underpin their applications. We will frequently work through examples by hand to illustrate applied techniques. And, we will sometimes have discussions based on the primary literature.</p> <p>The in-class practice sessions are designed to help you learn the course material and become proficient in network analysis using Python. The practice session will consist of group work. During these sessions, we will manage and analyze real life data using Python’s <code>networkx</code> package. This software is freely available and can be installed on your personal computer. You will need to set these up on your machine or use a Colgate computer adequately configured. We will ensure that everyone is set up with proper hardware and software tools during the first week.</p> <h2 id=course_resources ><a href="#course_resources" class=header-anchor >Course Resources</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>Recommended Textbooks</p> <ul> <li><p>Network Science, <em>Albert-László Barabási</em>, Cambridge University Press &#40;2016&#41;</p> <li><p>Networks – 2nd Edition, <em>Mark Newman</em>, Oxford University Press &#40;2018&#41;</p> <li><p>Complex Network Analysis in Python, <em>Dmitriy Zinoviev</em>, Pragmatic Bookshelf &#40;2018&#41;</p> </ul> <li><p>Popular Science Books</p> <p>I will assign readings from the following popular science books throughout the semester.

Here are a few of the articles that you will read this semester &#40;subject to change&#41;.</p> <ul> <li><p>DiMaggio, Paul, and Filiz Garip. &quot;Network effects and social inequality.&quot; Annual review of sociology 38 &#40;2012&#41;: 93-118.</p> <li><p>Guney, Emre, Jörg Menche, Marc Vidal, and Albert-László Barábasi. &quot;Network-based in silico drug efficacy screening.&quot; Nature communications 7, no. 1 &#40;2016&#41;: 1-13.</p> <li><p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/understanding-social-networks/201203/social-networks-and-inequality">Social Networks and Inequality: How Facebook contributes to economic &#40;and other&#41; inequality.</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://hbr.org/2020/07/use-your-social-network-as-a-tool-for-social-justice?utm_medium&#61;email&amp;utm_source&#61;newsletter_daily&amp;utm_campaign&#61;mtod&amp;referral&#61;00203">Use Your Social Network as a Tool for Social Justice</a></p> </ul> <li><p>Python Software</p> <p>For students that are particularly keen to learn all that you can about the software program that we will be using &#40;Python&#41;, you might consult the following book.</p> <ul> <li><p>Learning Python – 5th Edition, <em>Mark Lutz</em>, O’Reilly Books &#40;2013&#41;</p> </ul> <li><p>Moodle</p> <p>The syllabus, homework assignments and other important communications will be conveyed via <a href="http://moodle.colgate.edu/">Moodle</a>. Materials that I expect you to have reviewed will be referred to and/or placed at the Moodle website for this course. Please see that site regularly so that you can keep up with things.</p> <li><p>Gradescope</p> <p>I will use the Gradescope website to collect some of the graded assignments. Please upload the assignments to this website as directed.</p> </ul> <h2 id=grading ><a href="#grading" class=header-anchor >Grading</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Participation</strong> &#40;10&#37;&#41;: You are expected to attend the class and urged to ask questions in class whenever you believe this will enhance your understanding. Class attendance/participation will be noted and will contribute to your overall assessment in the course.</p> <li><p><strong>Homework Assignments</strong> &#40;25&#37;&#41;: You will learn how to do network analysis by doing network analysis, day in and day out. Assignments will involve questions, homework problems, reading assignments &#40;see the daily schedule at the last page&#41;, and short writing assignments. They will be due on Monday each week except for break and take-home exam weeks.</p> <ul> <li><p>Homework assignments will be posted on Moodle/Gradescope and are due at the end of the day on the scheduled date.</p> <li><p>You must pay close attention to the formatting of homework responses. Assignments should be presented in a clear, professional, and precise manner.</p> <li><p>Please do not submit your assignments by email.</p> <li><p>You may work together on the homework assignments, but the submitted work should be yours and yours alone.</p> <li><p>If you have questions concerning the grading, please let me know.</p> <li><p>Please keep in mind that some questions may be graded based on their completion. Answers will be provided to these questions.</p> </ul> <li><p><strong>Exams</strong> &#40;20&#37; each&#41;: There are two midterm exams in this course. Midterm exams will include in-class and take-home portions. Take-home exams are “open book” and “open note”. You should do your own independent work on all exams.</p> <li><p><strong>Final Project</strong> &#40;25&#37;&#41;: Students will collect data reflecting a real network of their choice for the final project and analyze it using the network measures and computational tools given in class. The goal is to provide a complete story: what does network science teach us about the organization and function of the system?</p> <li><p><strong>Late or Missed Work</strong>: Missed activities can only be made up or omitted from consideration in cases of verifiable hardship &#40;e.g., serious illness&#41;. This applies to deadlines for assignments as well. Late work will be penalized at 10&#37; per calendar day up to a maximum of 30&#37;. No work will be accepted after four days.</p> <li><p><strong>Letter Grade</strong>: Your course grade will be determined by a subjective curve based upon the accumulation of your points. Comparing your grades with the class averages will give an indication of your tentative letter grade for the course. Note that the course grade is directly dependent upon your performance on each of the assignments and exams.</p> </ul> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Tazmilur Saad, Ahmet Ay.
