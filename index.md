# Networks

We now live in a small world where everything is connected to everything else. Indeed, networks are all
around us, from the human brain to the internet to our circle of friends. All networks have an underlying
order and adhere to basic laws. Understanding the structure and behavior of these networks will allow us
to achieve amazing things, such as finding terrorists and halting a disease epidemic before it spreads.

This course provides a broad overview of network science-addressing the computational techniques of
network science as well as their applications and implications in biology, sociology, technology, and
other fields. Across this course, we will build networks in a variety of fields, demonstrating that
social networks, the internet, and cells are more alike than they are distinct -- revealing crucial new
insights into the linked world around us. Aside from the simple structural properties of real-world
networks, the course will also cover topics such as dynamic network activities, including epidemics,
network robustness, and communities in networks. We will also discuss the societal effects and
implications of network analysis.

Students will have the opportunity to apply what they've learned about
network science to real-world network data sets of their own choice. The course will present an exciting
glimpse of the future century in science, in an inherently and increasingly interconnected world.

## Course Objectives

On completion of this course, students should be able to do the following:

- Understand and apply basic network science techniques.
- Know how to execute network analysis in Python.
- Know how to use network science on real life datasets, and properly interpret results

## Class Format

The class itself will be lecture format. These lectures will focus on the network theory and definitions
that underpin their applications. We will frequently work through examples by hand to illustrate applied
techniques. And, we will sometimes have discussions based on the primary literature.

The in-class practice sessions are designed to help you learn the course material and become proficient
in network analysis using Python. The practice session will consist of group work. During these sessions,
we will manage and analyze real life data using Python’s `networkx` package. This software is freely
available and can be installed on your personal computer. You will need to set these up on your machine
or use a Colgate computer adequately configured. We will ensure that everyone is set up with proper
hardware and software tools during the first week.

- Popular Science Books

  I will assign readings from the following popular science books throughout the semester. I encourage you
  to read the text assignments before coming to the lecture.

- Scientific Papers and News Articles

  We will also read scientific papers and news articles to supplement the material covered in class. Here
  are a few of the articles that you will read this semester (subject to change).

- Python Software

  For students that are particularly keen to learn all that you can about the software
  program that we will be using (Python), you might consult the following book.

  - Learning Python – 5th Edition, _Mark Lutz_, O’Reilly Books (2013)

- Moodle

  The syllabus, homework assignments and other important communications will be conveyed
  via [Moodle](http://moodle.colgate.edu/). Materials that I expect you to have reviewed will be referred to
  and/or placed at the Moodle website for this course. Please see that site regularly so that you can keep up
  with things.

- Gradescope

  I will use the Gradescope website to collect some of the graded assignments. Please upload the assignments to this website as directed.

## Grading

- **Participation** (10%): You are expected to attend the class and urged to ask questions in class whenever
  you believe this will enhance your understanding. Class attendance/participation will be noted and will
  contribute to your overall assessment in the course.

- **Homework Assignments** (25%): You will learn how to do network analysis by doing network analysis,
  day in and day out. Assignments will involve questions, homework problems, reading assignments (see
  the daily schedule at the last page), and short writing assignments. They will be due on Monday each
  week except for break and take-home exam weeks.

  - Homework assignments will be posted on Moodle/Gradescope and are due at the end of the day on
    the scheduled date.

  - You must pay close attention to the formatting of homework responses. Assignments should be
    presented in a clear, professional, and precise manner.

  - Please do not submit your assignments by email.

  - You may work together on the homework assignments, but the submitted work should be yours and
    yours alone.

  - If you have questions concerning the grading, please let me know.

  - Please keep in mind that some questions may be graded based on their completion. Answers will be
    provided to these questions.

- **Exams** (20% each): There are two midterm exams in this course. Midterm exams will include in-class
  and take-home portions. Take-home exams are “open book” and “open note”. You should do your own
  independent work on all exams.

- **Final Project** (25%): Students will collect data reflecting a real network of their choice for the final
  project and analyze it using the network measures and computational tools given in class. The goal is to
  provide a complete story: what does network science teach us about the organization and function of the
  system?

- **Late or Missed Work**: Missed activities can only be made up or omitted from consideration in cases of
  verifiable hardship (e.g., serious illness). This applies to deadlines for assignments as well. Late work will
  be penalized at 10% per calendar day up to a maximum of 30%. No work will be accepted after four days.

- **Letter Grade**: Your course grade will be determined by a subjective curve based upon the accumulation
  of your points. Comparing your grades with the class averages will give an indication of your tentative
  letter grade for the course. Note that the course grade is directly dependent upon your performance on
  each of the assignments and exams.
